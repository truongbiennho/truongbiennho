Offshore oil reservoirs have been becoming significantly depleted, leading oil companies to discover deep-sea reservoirs with high investments and spend state-of-the-art technology. However, these projects are often high risky. Thus, the optimal solution is to recover more oil as optimization of treatment parameters for enhanced oil production is needed. After many years of exploitation, the production rate at the lower Oligocene reservoir of the White Tiger field has been tended to decline production. Many exploitation wells have a high water cut and high gas content, and low reservoir pressure. There are a wide variety of methods used the most to increase oil recovery including thermal method, chemical method and other methods that are less commonly used for oil recovery in the White Tiger field such as microbiological methods, electrical treatment, chemical treatment, hydraulic fracturing, selective water zone isolation, horizontal drilling This study presents the application of response surface methodology and the Box-Behnken design for investigating the effect of some major treatment parameters on production performance by hydraulic fracturing stimulation in the medium permeability area of the Lower Oligocene sandstone reservoir in the Cuu Long Basin, offshore Vietnam. Four major treatment design variables were influenced by the production performance, which enhances oil production when the maximum net present value was obtained. The results showed that the maximum net present value was obtained of 51.78$mm under the injection rate of 36.8bpm, an injection time of 80.5minutes, the proppant concentration end of the job of 9.3ppg, the leak-off coefficient was 0.003 ft/min0.5.
